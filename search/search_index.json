Source Code : https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/pytoil Documentation : https://FollowTheProcess.github.io/pytoil/ pytoil is still in Alpha and as such, the API may change without deprecation notices. What is it? \u00b6 pytoil is a handy tool that helps you stay on top of all your projects, remote or local. It's primarily aimed at python developers but you could easily use it to manage any project! pytoil is: Easy to use Easy to configure Safe (it won't edit your repos at all) Snappy (it's asynchronous from the ground up and as much as possible is done concurrently, clone all your repos in seconds!) \ud83d\udca8 Useful! (I hope ) Say goodbye to janky bash scripts Background \u00b6 Like many developers I suspect, I quickly became bored of typing repeated commands to manage my projects, create virtual environments, install packages, fire off cURL snippets to check if I had a certain repo etc. So I wrote some shell functions to do some of this for me... And these shell functions grew and grew and grew. Until one day I saw that the file I kept these functions in was over 1000 lines of bash (a lot of printf 's so it wasn't all logic but still). And 1000 lines of bash is waaaay too much! And because I'd basically hacked it all together, it was very fragile. If a part of a function failed, it would just carry on and wreak havoc! I'd have to do rm -rf all_my_projects ... I mean careful forensic investigation to fix it. So I decided to make a robust CLI with the proper error handling and testability of python, and here it is! Installation \u00b6 As pytoil is a CLI program, I'd recommend installing with pipx . $ pipx install pytoil ---> 100% Successfully installed pytoil Note If you don't know what pipx is, go check it out! But basically it allows python CLI tools to be installed in their own sandboxed environments but you can still access the CLI as if it was installed globally! You can always fall back to pip $ python3 -m pip install pytoil ---> 100% Successfully installed pytoil Warning keep in mind though, you'll have to install it globally for it to work so it might be better to use pipx pytoil will install everything it needs in python to work. However, it's full feature set can only be accessed if you have the following external dependencies: git conda (if you work with conda environments) VSCode (if you want to use pytoil to automatically open your projects for you) Quickstart \u00b6 pytoil is super easy to get started with. After installation, the first time you run it it will make you a config file. $ pytoil No config file yet! Making you a default one... This will create a default config file which can be found at ~/.pytoil.yml . See config for what information you need to put in here. Don't worry though, there's only a few options to configure!

The checkout command lets you easily resume work on an existing project, whether that project is available locally in your configured projects directory, or if it is on GitHub. If pytoil finds your project locally, and you have enabled VSCode in your config file it will open it for you. If not, it will just tell you it already exists locally and where to find it. If your project is on your GitHub, pytoil will clone it for you and then open it (or tell you where it cloned it if you dont have VSCode set up). Finally, if checkout can't find a match after searching locally and on GitHub, it will prompt you to use 'pytoil new' to create a new one. If you pass the shorthand to someone elses repo e.g. 'someoneelse/repo' pytoil will detect this and automatically create a fork of this repo for you. Forking happens asynchronously so we give it a few seconds, then check whether or not your fork exists yet. If it does, all is well and we can clone it for you automatically. If not, (which is totally normal), we'll let you know. In which case just give it a few seconds then a 'pytoil checkout repo' will bring it down as normal. You can also ask pytoil to automatically create a virtual environment on checkout with the '--venv/-v' flag. This only happens for projects pulled down from GitHub to avoid accidentally screwing up local projects. If the '--venv/-v' flag is used, pytoil will look at your project to try and detect which type of environment to create e.g. conda, flit, poetry, standard python etc. The '--venv/-v' flag will also attempt to detect if the project you're checking out is a python package, in which case it will install it's requirements into the created environment. More info about this can be found in the documentation.

Cloning... // You might see some git clone output here Opening 'my_github_project' in VSCode... Why just VSCode? When developing pytoil I was debating how to handle this. I use VSCode for everything but I know other people have different editor preferences. Initially I looked at using the $EDITOR environment variable but working out how best to launch a variety of possible editors from a CLI was tricky. Plus pytoil does things like alter workspace settings to point at the right virtual environment, and I only know how to do this with VSCode. PR's are very welcome though if you think you can introduce support for your preferred editor! Someone else's project \u00b6 A common workflow in open source is to fork someone elses project and then work on your fork. With pytoil this can be done in the same command! If you provide the shorthand repo path to pytoil checkout e.g. someoneelse/repo , pytoil will: Fork the repo for you Clone your fork Add the original repo as remote 'upstream' Basically all the chores you would have to do to work on a open source project! // Someone else's project $ pytoil checkout someone/their_github_project Project: 'someone/their_github_project' belongs to 'someone' Forking... Cloning... More awesome stuff! Note Forking happens asynchronously on GitHub's end and there is no guarantee on a timeline (although GitHub is very well engineered and this normally happens pretty much straight away) so we make a best effort here to wait for GitHub's internal state to synchronise and check if the fork was a success. However, this can sometimes time out, in which case pytoil will let you know and handle this gracefully If this happens to you, all you need to do is wait a few seconds and then try pytoil checkout <project> again. Automatically Create a Virtual Environment \u00b6 If you pass the --venv option, checkout will also: Try to detect what environment would work best for the project (conda, venv, flit, poetry) Auto create this virtual environment Look for requirements files that specify dependencies such as environment.yml for conda, setup.cfg or setup.py for normal python packages etc. If you have VSCode configured, pytoil will also set your workspace python.defaultInterpreterPath Note From about version 1.57.1, VSCode have been deprecating the workspace setting python.pythonPath in favour of python.defaultInterpreterPath which up until v0.6.0, pytoil used as part of the whole \"automate your dev life\" thing! These settings do differ in their functionality, which you can read about here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/12313 . But it turns out that because the only time we set this is when creating brand new projects, or checking out remote projects, these settings behave exactly the same for us, so it effectively represents a straight swap. // Some project that's on GitHub $ pytoil checkout my_github_project --venv Project: 'my_github_project' found on GitHub! Cloning... // You might see some git clone output here Auto-creating correct virtual environment // Here you might see some conda or venv stuff Opening 'my_github_project' in VSCode... Note pytoil looks for certain files in your project (like setup.py , setup.cfg , pyproject.toml , environment.yml etc.) and that's how it decides which environment to create. If it isn't totally sure what environment to create, it will just skip this step and let you know! I've personally tested this on every type of environment pytoil supports and it works really well! How pytoil Knows What to Install \u00b6 The --venv implementation is quite complex (and it took me a while to get it right!) but effectively, pytoil will look at the contents of your cloned project to decide what to do, create the matching virtual environment, then delegate to the appropriate tool to install dependencies. A summary of what pytoil does when it finds certain files is found below, the search priority is in the same order as presented and pytoil will match on the first found condition to create the environment: environment.yml \u00b6 Must mean it's a conda project, delegate to conda using conda env create --file environment.yml requirements.txt or requirements_dev.txt \u00b6 Python script or non-package project e.g. django web app, delegate to pip using pip install -r <file> Prefers requirements_dev.txt if present as it will have everything needed to work on the project, falls back to requirements.txt if not. setup.cfg or setup.py \u00b6 Python package, again delegate to pip using pip install -e .[dev] Defaults to using the [dev] target for convention and to ensure the entire dev environment is set up, if this isn't present pip automatically falls back to pip install -e . pyproject.toml specifying poetry as a build tool \u00b6 Python package managed with poetry , here we basically delegate everything to poetry as it handles both the virtual environment and installation of dependencies. pytoil is effectively doing poetry install as you might yourself. pyproject.toml specifying flit as a build tool \u00b6 Python package managed with flit , here we create a virtual environment the normal python way, then delegate to flit to install dependencies. Something like flit install called from the directory of the project. (We actually do a bit more than this to make sure it only targets your local environment for that project, but that's the gist of it!) Else \u00b6 If we get here, pytoil gives up and will tell you something along the lines of \"could not detect correct virtual environment. skipping\". Your project will still be checked out, but you'll have to do the virtual environment stuff yourself I'm afraid! But we gave it our best shot! Note Although we've tried to make the implementation of this as robust as possible, it's quite complex and there's bound to be edge cases lurking here somewhere. If you hit any, please file an issue and maybe even try and fix it yourself and throw us a PR Remember if you need more custom behaviour than this, you can just plain pytoil checkout without the --venv and pytoil won't try and be clever, it will just straight up clone the project for you to do whatever you want with!","title":"Checkout"},{"location":"commands/checkout.html#checkout","text":"checkout (not to be confused with git checkout ) allows to easily resume work on an ongoing development project.","title":"Checkout"},{"location":"commands/checkout.html#help","text":"$ pytoil checkout --help Usage: pytoil checkout [OPTIONS] PROJECT Checkout an existing development project.

Bare usage will simply create an empty folder in your configured projects directory. You can also create a project from a cookiecutter template by passing a valid url to the '--cookie/-c' flag. If you just want a very simple, language-specific starting template, use the '--starter/-s' option. By default, pytoil will initialise an empty git repo in the folder, following the style of modern language build tools such as rust's cargo. You can disable this behaviour by setting 'init_on_new' to false in pytoil's config file or by passing the '--no-git/-n' flag here. If you want pytoil to create a new virtual environment for your project, you can use the '--venv/-v' flag. Standard python and conda virtual environments are supported. If the '--venv/-v' flag is used, you may also pass a list of python packages to install into the created virtual environment. These will be delegated to the appropriate tool (pip or conda) depending on what environment was created. If the environment is conda, the packages will be passed at environment creation time meaning they will have their dependencies resolved together. Normal python environments will first be created and then have specified packages installed. If 'common_packages' is specified in pytoil's config file, these will automatically be included in the environment. To specify versions of packages via the command line, you must enclose them in double quotes e.g. \"flask>=1.0.0\" not flask>=1.0.0 otherwise this will be interpreted by the shell as a command redirection.

In this sense, you don't have to be a python developer to use pytoil! $ pytoil new my_new_project Creating new project: 'my_new_project' // Does some stuff... New Git Repo \u00b6 By default, pytoil will also create an empty git repository in this folder for you. You can disable this behaviour by changing the value for init_on_new in your config file, or on a per use basis by using the --no-git flag. You will need git installed to be able to use this feature. $ pytoil new my_new_project --no-git Creating new project: 'my_new_project' // Does some stuff...but not git Note A lot of modern language tools (e.g. rust's cargo ) initialise a git repo by default and I liked the idea so here it is Include Virtual Environment \u00b6 If you are a python developer though, chances are you'll want to create a virtual environment with your project. pytoil supports both venv and conda environments, although for the latter you'll have to have the conda package manager already installed on your system. I personally recommend miniconda as you get the package manager but none of the bundled packages (which can be quite large!). For standard python virtual environments, pytoil uses the standard library venv module so you don't need to install anything external. If you want to use conda environments though, you'll need to have a conda package manager installed and available on $PATH. Info If you don't know what conda is: as a general rule, you'll want to use venv on most python projects (particularly packages i.e. things that can be pip installed). If you do a lot of work with data (think pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) you'll probably want to use conda as a lot of python data tools include native C libraries which require compiling, and conda makes this happen seamlessly Pytoil has been tested and supports the following conda distributions: Anaconda Miniconda Miniforge Mambaforge All you have to do is specify which virtual environment to create, using the --venv/-v option flag. You can choose from venv or conda . The default is None . $ pytoil new my_new_project --venv venv Creating new project: 'my_new_project' Creating virtual environment for: 'my_new_project' Or with conda... $ pytoil new my_new_project --venv conda Creating new project: 'my_new_project' Creating conda environment for: 'my_new_project' // Conda environments typically take a bit longer to make as it has to do a bit more work! Install Packages at Creation \u00b6 A blank virtual environment isn't really much use yet! pytoil lets you inject packages at environment creation time! All you have to do is pass packages you want to install into the new environment as additional command line arguments and pytoil will figure this all out for you. $ pytoil new my_new_project --venv conda pandas numpy scikit-learn Creating new project: 'my_new_project' Creating conda environment for: 'my_new_project' Including packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn // Conda environments typically take a bit longer to make as it has to do a bit more work! Note This is also where the common_packages setting from the config file comes in! If you specify packages here, these will automatically get injected into every environment pytoil creates, whether its a python virtual environment or a conda environment. This is particularly useful for development dependencies like linters and formatters etc. Build a project from a Cookiecutter Template \u00b6 If you don't know what cookiecutter is, go and check them out! Essentially, it is a templating engine for development projects and, after asking you a few questions, it can dynamically insert and modify text inside your project, set up directory structure and all sorts of cool automation stuff! It means that if you find a template you like (or make your own) you can use it as the base for development projects without having to create so much boilerplate at the beginning, they're great Note In fact, pytoil was itself started from a cookiecutter template! This one: https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/poetry_pypackage Because I love cookiecutter so much, I built pytoil to support them easily. You can create a new project from a cookiecutter template by using the --cookie/-c flag like this: // Just pass a url to a cookiecutter template $ pytoil new my_new_project --cookie https://github.com/some/cookie.git Creating new project: 'my_new_project' from cookiecutter: 'https://github.com/some/cookie.git' Create from a starter \u00b6 pytoil also comes with a few basic starter templates for some common languages. How it creates these templates is specific to the language, but you can use them like this.... Here's a python one: // Just pass a valid starter $ pytoil new my_new_python_project --starter python Creating new project: 'my_new_python_project' from starter: 'python' And with go: // Just pass a valid starter $ pytoil new my_new_go_project --starter go Creating new project: 'my_new_go_project' from starter: 'go' Note Currently pytoil supports python, go and rust starter templates. The starters are super easy to implement though so if you want more languages supported, maybe throw us a PR The table below shows what happens under the hood when a starter is given to pytoil new : Starter Implementation python Creates everything internally using pathlib go Creates the root directory and main.go internally. Then calls go mod init rust Creates the root directory internally. Then calls cargo init All in One Go \u00b6 Because pytoil uses typer for it's CLI, the arguments and options to CLI commands are all resolved really intelligently so you can specify all of them in one go if you like to get complex behaviour! $ pytoil new my_new_project --cookie https://github.com/some/cookie.git --venv venv --no-git requests \"flask>=1.0.0\" sqlalchemy // Many things will now happen!

I personally recommend miniconda as you get the package manager but none of the bundled packages (which can be quite large!). For standard python virtual environments, pytoil uses the standard library venv module so you don't need to install anything external. If you want to use conda environments though, you'll need to have a conda package manager installed and available on $PATH. Info If you don't know what conda is: as a general rule, you'll want to use venv on most python projects (particularly packages i.e. things that can be pip installed). If you do a lot of work with data (think pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) you'll probably want to use conda as a lot of python data tools include native C libraries which require compiling, and conda makes this happen seamlessly Pytoil has been tested and supports the following conda distributions: Anaconda Miniconda Miniforge Mambaforge All you have to do is specify which virtual environment to create, using the --venv/-v option flag. You can choose from venv or conda . The default is None . $ pytoil new my_new_project --venv venv Creating new project: 'my_new_project' Creating virtual environment for: 'my_new_project' Or with conda... $ pytoil new my_new_project --venv conda Creating new project: 'my_new_project' Creating conda environment for: 'my_new_project' // Conda environments typically take a bit longer to make as it has to do a bit more work!","title":"Include Virtual Environment"},{"location":"commands/new.html#install-packages-at-creation","text":"A blank virtual environment isn't really much use yet! pytoil lets you inject packages at environment creation time!

It means that if you find a template you like (or make your own) you can use it as the base for development projects without having to create so much boilerplate at the beginning, they're great Note In fact, pytoil was itself started from a cookiecutter template! This one: https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/poetry_pypackage Because I love cookiecutter so much, I built pytoil to support them easily.

Here's how to go about doing it! Note All contributors must follow the Code of Conduct Developing \u00b6 If you want to fix a bug, improve the docs, add tests, add a feature or any other type of direct contribution to pytoil: here's how you do it! To work on pytoil you'll need python >=3.8 Step 1: Fork pytoil \u00b6 The first thing to do is 'fork' pytoil. This will put a version of it on your GitHub page. This means you can change that fork all you want and the actual version of pytoil still works! To create a fork, go to the pytoil repo and click on the fork button! Step 2: Clone your fork \u00b6 Navigate to where you do your development work on your machine and open a terminal If you use HTTPS: git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/pytoil.git If you use SSH: git clone git@github.com:<your_github_username>/pytoil.git Or you can be really fancy and use the GH CLI gh repo clone <your_github_username>/pytoil HTTPS is probably the one most people use! Once you've cloned the project, cd into it... cd pytoil This will take you into the root directory of the project. Now add the original pytoil repo as an upstream in your forked project: git remote add upstream https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/pytoil.git This makes the original version of pytoil upstream but not origin . Basically, this means that if your working on it for a while and the original project has changed in the meantime, you can do: git checkout main git fetch upstream git merge upstream/main git push origin main This will (in order): Checkout the main branch of your locally cloned fork Fetch any changes from the original project that have happened since you forked it Merge those changes in with what you have Push those changes up to your fork so your fork stays up to date with the original. Note Good practice is to do this before you start doing anything every time you start work, then the chances of you getting conflicting commits later on is much lower! Step 3: Create the Environment \u00b6 Before you do anything, you'll want to set up your development environment... pytoil uses poetry to manage development and nox for automation superpowers. So to work on it you'll need to get both of those tools too! I recommend using pipx for python command line tools like these, it installs each tool in it's own isolated environment but exposes the command to your terminal as if you installed it globally. We've automated the crap out of the development process for pytoil, to get started all you need to do is run: nox Note If you've never used nox before, go check it out. It's great! It's an amazing project automation toolkit, you can do just about anything with it but it's especially good at things like this! When you run this, nox will: Create a fresh python virtual environment in the project for you (.venv) Install pytoil for you along with all of it's development dependencies Make sure VSCode is set up to use this environment (if you use it) Not bad for a single command! Doing it this way means that before you start working on pytoil you know its all been installed and works correctly. Wait for it to do it's thing and then you can get started. Note The next time you run nox , it won't do this step again. It will run all the project tests, lint and format the source code, analyse test coverage and build the docs Step 4: Do your thing \u00b6 Always checkout a new branch before changing anything git checkout -b <name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature> Now you're ready to start working! Remember! pytoil aims for high test coverage. If you implement a new feature, make sure to write tests for it! Similarly, if you fix a bug, it's good practice to write a test that would have caught that bug so we can be sure it doesn't reappear in the future! pytoil uses nox for automated testing, building the docs, formatting and linting etc. So when you've made your changes, just run: nox And it will tell you if something's wrong! Step 5: Commit your changes \u00b6 Once you're happy with what you've done, add the files you've changed: git add <changed-file ( s ) > # Might be easier to do git add -A # But be wary of this and check what it's added is what you wanted.. git status Commit your changes: git commit # Now write a good commit message explaining what you've done and why. While you were working on your changes, the original project might have changed (due to other people working on it). So first, you should rebase your current branch from the upstream destination. Doing this means that when you do your PR, it's all compatible: git pull --rebase upstream main Now push your changes to your fork: git push origin <your-branch-name> Step 6: Create a Pull Request \u00b6 Now go to the original pytoil repo and create a Pull Request. Make sure to choose upstream repo \"main\" as the destination branch and your forked repo \"your-branch-name\" as the source. That's it! Your code will be tested automatically by pytoil's CI suite and if everything passes and your PR is approved and merged then it will become part of pytoil! Note There is a good guide to open source contribution workflow here and also here too Contributing to Docs \u00b6 Any improvements to the documentation are always appreciated! pytoil uses mkdocs with the mkdocs-material theme so the documentation is all written in markdown and can be found in the docs folder in the project root. Because pytoil uses nox , things like building and serving the documentation is super easy. All you have to do is: # Builds the docs nox -s docs # Builds and serves nox -s docs -- serve If you use the serve option, you can navigate to the localhost IP address it gives you and as you make changes to the source files, it will automatically reload your browser! Automation is power! If you add pages to the docs, make sure they are placed in the nav tree in the mkdocs.yml file and you're good to go!","title":"Guide"},{"location":"contributing/contributing.html#contributing-to-pytoil","text":"I've tried to structure pytoil to make it nice and easy for people to contribute.
